# WordClock iOS

## This is old code from 2008!

This was written in 2008 for the original iPod Touch running iPhoneOS 2, and is complicated by its use of OpenGL to achieve my goal of running at 60fps. I have since made some minor changes to get this working with JSON and with latest Xcode / iOS. It is very dated otherwise.
